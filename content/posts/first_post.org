Writing is hard. This post won't make you a good writer, but you will understand how to structure your writing process *and*, some might argue more importantly, your knowledge.
I try not to dive too deep into the nitty gritty of software and tools out there; however, this post should give you a good understanding of what could be useful... and what not.

* The process
To outline the process into, I formulated 3 basic tasks - in reality, these concepts intersect and a good workflow should represent that.
I will touch on that later.
1. Information gathering - BE THE KRAKEN
2. Information processing - Create something new (and do experiments and stuff)
3. Information presentation - Share what you learned

** Information gathering   

** Information processing

** Information presentation

* Final thoughts
Obviously, all three phases can't and shouldn't be done without overlap.
